# Introduction

Hi, imagine this is a fancy well articulated 10-line paragraph that you've skimmed through. Now, let's get to business.



## What?

Reverse engineering (noun) is the copying of another company's product after examining it carefully to find out how it is made; except that's some bull that you find when googling. You need to forget everything you think you might possibly know about anything in your life, clear your head.

Reverse engineering (noun-really) is the act of understanding really-low-level code; mostly by using tools to convert it back to human-readable code. 

Based on this understanding one can then perform more advanced tasks such as changing the behavior of an application/program without the need to have access to its source code; cracks, patches, key generators, hacks, bots, things that could get you ~~kidnapped~~ arrested, and so on...



## Why?

Apart from the fact that you can make more money than all of your family members combined and multiplied by their count (should've just said powered?), it's fun, it makes you resourceful and it's a really helpful skill to have. 

**Here's a real-life story:**

Sfeenix (alias) works in a tech company that has many modules; web services, applications, programs... you get the idea) that are integrated together. His job as a developer is to maintain one and only one of these modules which means has no access to the source code of anything other than the module his team is assigned to work on. However; in order to run his module he needs to have the other modules up and running because they all rely on each other.

Sfeenix only has the executable files (think the .exe file that you double-click to run) of these other modules and he just runs them before compiling & running his source code. Everything seems to work fine but there's something that's not working in his own module. After deep and thorough investigations he finds out there's something wrong with one of the modules (again, .exe file) that he ran but he cannot figure out what exactly. Typically, Sfeenix will have to get back to the team that is responsible for this (allegedly) faulty module and figure out exactly what, where and why is there something wrong with his life; which will probably take a lot of effort & even more time.

Luckly, Rawr (another alias) is an OG reverser that can save Sfeenix from all the laughter and humiliation coming from the other team because he hasn't properly followed the installation guide for the module he obtained from them. Rawr reverses the faulty module and finds out that it requires to be executed as an administrator instead of blindly double clicking it; also there is a folder that Sfeenix deleted because it was empty but is still required by the module at some point during runtime.



## Where?

Haha, so, are you still interested to learn how to be like Rawr? It requires patience, dedication, a sharp mind and the complete opposite of Sfeenix's mindset because he went to his Product Manager and reported Rawr for hacking into the company's files.

You can move on to either the [Java](soon-tm) section, the [Native](soon-tm) (.exe and shit) section, or both if your brain is bigger than your balls. If you don't know how to get there then don't bother.
